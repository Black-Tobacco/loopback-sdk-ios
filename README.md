## iOS

The LoopBack iOS SDK obviates the need for using the clunky `NSURLRequest` and
similar interfaces to interact with a LoopBack-based backend, albeit RESTful.
Instead, interact with your Models and Data Sources in a comfortable,
first-class, native manner.

See [LoopBack iOS SDK](http://docs.strongloop.com/loopback-clients/ios/api/annotated.html) for API reference documentation.
