LoopBack iOS SDK
=======
## iOS

The LoopBack iOS SDK obviates the need for using the clunky `NSURLRequest` and
similar interfaces to interact with a LoopBack-based backend, albeit RESTful.
Instead, interact with your Models and Data Sources in a comfortable,
first-class, native manner.

See [LoopBack iOS SDK](http://apidocs.strongloop.com/loopback-sdk-ios/api/annotated.html) for API reference documentation.

> This section describes v1.1 version of the LoopBack iOS SDK. The following API
> changes were made:
>
>  - `LBModelPrototype` was renamed to `LBModelRepository`
>  - `findWithId` was renamed to `findById`

See  [iOS v1.0](http://apidocs.strongloop.com/loopback-sdk-ios/api-1.0/annotated.html) for version 1.0 API reference documentation.
